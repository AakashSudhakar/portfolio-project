# My Portfolio 

Repository to track changes and updates regarding my professional portfolio page. 

Planning changes and additional details will be posted here for readability. 

## Project Planning

This project leverages mostly vanilla CSS and HTML alongside Flexbox and basic Tailwind for some specific animation styling on the front end. 

<!-- ## Future Planning

This project will leverage **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)**, a React framework.

In order to most effectively use this framework and its associated dependencies/utilities, some time will be taken to study up on the corresponding dialect of JavaScript.

As such, subsequent project updates will be conducted after a rudimentary foundation of Next.js proficiency is built.

Please check back later. -->
